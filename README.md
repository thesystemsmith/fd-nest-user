my raw blueprint of designing the full stack kafka based app for food delivery product is as follows


Service Responsibilities
Spring Boot Backend (Port 8080) - Order & Payment Service

Order CRUD operations
Payment simulation (approve/reject)
Order status management
Consumes: user.created, user.updated (to cache user data)
Publishes: order.created, order.updated, payment.processed
Database: PostgreSQL

NestJS Backend (Port 3000) - User & Auth Service

User registration & login
JWT token generation/validation
User profile management (CRUD)
Notification service (email simulation)
Publishes: user.created, user.updated
Consumes: order.created, order.updated (to send notifications)
Database: MongoDB

React Frontend

Login/Register with JWT
Role-based views (USER vs ADMIN)
User Dashboard: View own orders, profile
Admin Dashboard: Manage all orders, view all users
JWT stored in localStorage with expiry check

Kafka Topics

user.created - New user registered
user.updated - Profile updated
order.created - New order placed
order.updated - Order status changed (pending → paid → shipped → delivered)
payment.processed - Payment approved/rejected


🔐 Authentication Flow
1. User registers → NestJS creates user → Publishes user.created
2. User logs in → NestJS validates → Returns JWT (access + refresh tokens)
3. Frontend stores JWT → Sends with every request
4. Spring Boot validates JWT by calling NestJS /auth/verify endpoint
   OR both services share same JWT secret (simpler for demo)
5. JWT contains: { userId, email, role: 'USER' | 'ADMIN' }
```

## 📊 Complete Event Flow Examples

### **Scenario 1: User Places Order**
```
1. Frontend (USER) → POST /api/orders → Spring Boot
2. Spring Boot creates order → Publishes order.created to Kafka
3. NestJS consumes order.created → Sends email: "Order confirmed"
```

### **Scenario 2: Admin Updates Order Status**
```
1. Frontend (ADMIN) → PATCH /api/orders/:id/status → Spring Boot
2. Spring Boot updates order → Publishes order.updated to Kafka
3. NestJS consumes order.updated → Sends email: "Order shipped"
```

### **Scenario 3: User Updates Profile**
```
1. Frontend → PATCH /api/users/profile → NestJS
2. NestJS updates user → Publishes user.updated to Kafka
3. Spring Boot consumes user.updated → Updates cached user data

- im using flat repo style as am the only one working on this project and dont want multiple folders, but for a bigger project its better to follow nest idiom based repo style as splitting task in a bigger team bigger team becomes easier

- using only access token with 7 days exp, but better UX is refresh token, if i feel ill add this later, for now keeping it simple
